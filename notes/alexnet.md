## ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

AlexNet, a breakthrough in deep learning. Won ILSVRC-2012 with breaking state-of-the-art.

#### key points

* 5 convolution layers followed by max pooling, 2 fully connected layers, 1000 softmax layer
* Applied ReLU, dropout, local response normalization, overlapping pooling
* Train on multiple GPUs

#### thoughts

* This kind of network structures are seen very often these days
    * assuming because of this paper's good result
