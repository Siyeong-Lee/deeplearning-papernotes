## DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation

VAE with attention. Learns to generate images like human does.

#### key points

* VAE's one-shot approach is hard to generate large images
* Inspiration comes from the fact that people recurrently touches their work to generate one image
* Image is generated by recurrent access to image and write to canvas
    * Attention is used for focusing to a spot at a single step
    * Gaussian filter is used for attention
* Two LSTM nets are used to read and write, passing its output to next sequence
* To generate a new image, latent sample is picked from prior P, then running the decoder to update the canvas matrix
* Without attention, image gets clearer as sequence pasts and with attention, image is drawn as attention moves

#### thoughts

* When GAN learns only to trick discriminator, VAE and DRAW can learn to generate images with features from training images
* Don't understand exactly how samples from prior P are used for generating a single image
    * Don't those samples each implement different features?
* Attention is becoming an indispensable idea over all fields
