## Neural Turing Machines

Extended capabilites of neural networks by coupling them to external memory resources. The combined system is analogous to a Truing Machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable end-to-end.

#### key points

* NTM can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples! (WOW)
* NTM is a differentiable computer that can be trained by gradient descent
* Resembles working memory of human brain and uses attention mechanism to choose what to read from memory
*
