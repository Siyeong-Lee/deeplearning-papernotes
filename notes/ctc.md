## Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling unsegmented Sequence Data with RNN

This paper presents a novel method called CTC for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving pre-segmenting, post-processing problem.

#### key points

* This paper classifies two ways for labelling data sequences, temporal classification(TC) and framewise classification(FC)
    * TC takes unsegmented data sequences as whole and provides whole labelling
    * FC provides independent labelling for each data frame
