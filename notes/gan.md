## Generative Adversarial Nets

This paper introduces an adversarial network which consists of two networks, Generator and Discriminator.
They help train each other by competing like a game. Generator tries to make samples that looks like real examples.
Discriminator estimates the probability that a sample came from training data rather than Generator.

#### key points

* Generator(G) and Discriminator(D) together works like an environment in reinforcement learning
* Not like other generative models, this network doesn't require approximate inference or Markov chains
* Training must be done one after another to avoid overfitting of Discriminator
* Proposed optimization algorithm can be proved that it heads toward global optimum if given enough capacity and training time
* Generator is only trained by gradients flowing through the discriminator, which avoids generator copying the input data

#### thoughts

* Good for me that it doesn't use complicated statistical knowledge
* The idea of adversarial is just awesome..
    * Discriminator trained like supervised learning but doesn't need labels!
    * Generator uses the gradient generated by Discriminator which removes need for inference and gives ability to generate unseen results
* Wonder if this model is actually applied to real world
